# About Me

I am passionate about design and technology so I always try to craft great-looking software products.

Before getting into software development, I wanted to be a cartographer and create pretty maps. My first encounter with programming came in university when i created a python script to automate data import in ArcGIS. After university, I realized what my real passion was and started learning more about software development.

I consider myself a curious and inquisitive person, so on my spare time I like to work on side projects, try to contribute to open source software and aim to constantly learn something new to improve my skillset.

When not writing software, I like to watch TV shows and movies, play some games with friends or hang out with them. I'm also listening to music most of the time. üòÅ
